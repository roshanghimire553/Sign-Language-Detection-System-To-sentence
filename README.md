# Sign-Language-Detection-System-To-sentence
American Sign Language (ASL) is the visual-general language used by deaf people in the United
States and parts of Canada. There is no universal sign language, different sign languages are used
in different countries or regions. No person or committee invented ASL the exact beginning of
ASL is not clear, but some suggest that it arose more than 200 years ago from the intermixing of
local sign languages and French sign language. The movements of hands and face express ASL It
is the primary language of many North Americans who are deaf and hard of hearing, and it is used
by many hearing people as well. ASL has a large area ofscope. Fingerspelling is part of ASL and is
used to spell out English words. In the figure-spelled alphabet, each letter corresponds to a distinct
handshape. 
# How to run this code 
in first download this repository to your local computer then after setup python with the required version 
step 1 : run file name imagecapture.py and start capturing hand landmark then image i saved on directory 
step 2 : after capturing dataset you can train data by using file name CNNmodel.py and model is saved which is further for data prediction
step 3: run file name final_pred.py which contains GUI and then place your hand then it show landmark on white image and image is predicted and show the suggestion also and click on speak for sound and clear for clearing all the text and sentence
